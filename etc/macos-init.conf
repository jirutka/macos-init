# The virtualization platform (and data source) this system is running on.
# Supported platforms: cloudinit-nocloud, opennebula.

# (without numeric prefix) of the scripts in $script_dirs.

# Directories where to look for the provisioning scripts. Their order matters;
# if a script of the same name is in multiple directories, the first one wins.

# Map platform-specific variables or directives to macos-init environment
# variables - a whitespace-separated list of <source-var>=<target-var>.
# A special keyword "+default" adds the default mappings.
#
# cloudinit-nocloud: <source-var> is a slash-separated path of a YAML key (e.g.
# 'hostname', 'users/1/name'). Arrays are 1-based indexed. If the key contains
# an array of scalars and you want to read them all as newline-separated values,
# append '/*' to the key-path (e.g. 'ssh_authorized_keys/*').
